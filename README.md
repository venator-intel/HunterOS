## ***Coming Soon...***

Welcome to HunterOS, a purpose-built Debian-based distribution designed for cyber intelligence collection & analysis. HunterOS integrates a comprehensive set of popular free and open-source tools focused on intelligence collection & analysis (OSINT, CYBINT, SOCMINT, etc.), malware analysis, and security research. 

Whether you are an intelligence analyst, cyber sleuth, or tactical deep-web diver, HunterOS provides a powerful platform to enhance your intelligence collection & analysis capabilities.

HunterOS started as a personal side project spawned from the idea to replicate the 'hacking distro' concept to the CTI community. Think Kali Linux or Parrot Security, but for the sole purpose of collecting, processing, analysing, and disseminating cyber threat intelligence. We haven't been too hasty with getting Venator done and dusted. Who knew building an OS fit for distribution actually requires some elbow grease? Other things have fallen onto our paths, like work, studies, and our personal lives that have resulted in the project being put on hold.
