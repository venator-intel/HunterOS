## ***Coming Soon...***

Welcome to Venator, a purpose-built Debian-based distribution designed for cyber intelligence collection & analysis. Venator integrates a comprehensive set of popular free and open-source tools focused on intelligence collection & analysis (OSINT, CYBINT, SOCMINT, etc.), malware analysis, and security research. 

Whether you are an intelligence analyst, cyber sleuth, or tactical deep-web diver, Venator provides a powerful platform to enhance your intelligence collection & analysis capabilities.

Venator started as a personal side project spawned from the idea to replicate the 'hacking distro' concept to the CTI community. Think Kali Linux or ParrotOS, but for the sole purpose of collecting, processing, analysing, and disseminating cyber threat intelligence. We haven't been too hasty with getting Venator done and dusted. Who knew building an OS fit for distribution actually requires some elbow grease? Other things have fallen onto our paths, like work, studies, and our personal lives that have resulted in the project being put on hold. 

It was not until we started to receive emails and messages asking about Venator that we realised there is genuine interest in such a platform from the community. This has definitely given us the motivation needed to focus more on the project. As such, we have decided to release an early access version of Venator in July 2024 with the aim to get feedback on the user experience, usefulness and relevance of the toolset, and overall improvement suggestions/common issues. If you'd be interested in joining the early access programme, please send an email to connect@mayanstegmann.com.
